In-depth Security Operations assistant. For guidance on usage, ask for `help`.

## Introduction

SOC Copilot is an in-depth Security Operations Center assistant, leveraging the capabilities of OpenAI's custom GPTs feature to deliver targeted support for cybersecurity professionals. This tool provides guidance on various aspects of Security Operations such as threat and vulnerability analysis, risk assessment, remediation strategies and compliance through a keyword-driven interface.

## Features

SOC Copilot supports a range of functionalities, which are triggered by the following keywords:

- `mitre`: Maps descriptions to specific MITRE ATT&CK stages.
- `analyse`: Interprets provided information to explain potential cybersecurity implications.
- `risk`: Identifies and assesses risks associated with provided information.
- `vulnerability`: Provides details on known vulnerabilities, their severity, and mitigation strategies.
- `compliance`: Guides on compliance with standards and regulations relevant to specific industries.
- `threat actor`: Details known threat actors, their techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs), and recent activities.
- `IoC`: Explains Indicators of Compromise for threat detection and response.
- `yara`: Assists in creating YARA rules based on provided or discovered data.
- `kql`: Supports the construction of KQL queries for triaging purposes.
- `malware`: Educates on malware families, TTPs, attack vectors, and aids in gathering IoCs.

## Future Features

Ideas to further enhance SOC Copilot include:

- Integration with real-time threat intelligence feeds for up-to-date IoC collection.
- Automated suggestions for hardening configurations based on identified vulnerabilities.
- Customisable alerting for new compliance regulations in specified industries.
- Enhanced natural language processing for more intuitive interaction.

## Usage

To utilise SOC Copilot, include the relevant keyword in your query. For example:

- To learn about a specific threat actor, use: `vulnerability [cve]`. SOC Copilot will gather information, risks and remediation strategies for this vulnerability.
- To collect IoCs for a type of malware, use: `ioc [name]`. SOC Copilot will provide a list of associated IoCs, like IPs, domains, and file hashes.
